Package: libyuma-base
Section: libs
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Multi-Arch: foreign
Description: Configuration script, YANG modules and documentation
 The NETCONF protocol and YANG modeling language provide a framework
 for the exchange of management information between agents (servers)
 and clients.
 .
 This package includes configuration scripts, documentation and YANG
 modules for the NETCONF an YANG libraries, agents and
 applications. YANG modules contain a formal description of the data that can be
 managed using NETCONF and applications.

Description: NETCONF/YANG library
 The NETCONF protocol and YANG modeling language provide a framework
 for the exchange of management information between agents (servers)
 and clients.
 .
 The yuma123 libyuma library contains common functions for the construction,
 sending, receiving, decoding, and manipulation of the NETCONF requests
 and responses.
